# **Neuron Simulation for Investigating Detection Range**

This repository contains the code and simulations for my masterâ€™s thesis titled: **"Simulating Neurons to Investigate Detection Range"**. The project uses computational models to explore the connection between firing neurons and extracellular signals. By simulating extracellular action potentials (EAP) from neuron models, the study investigates a possible explanation for the "dark matter problem" in the brain, where fewer neurons are detected than expected in electrode recordings.
