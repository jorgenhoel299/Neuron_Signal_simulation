# **Analysing the effect of neural morphology on extracellular spikes**

This repository houses the code and simulations for my thesis titled: Analyzing the Effect of Neural Morphology on Extracellular Spikes. The project employs computational models to investigate the relationship between firing neurons and extracellular signals. By simulating extracellular action potentials (EAP) from various neuron models, the study seeks to provide insights into the "dark matter problem" in the brain, which refers to the phenomenon of fewer neurons being detected in electrode recordings than anticipated.
